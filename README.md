# WCGNA_analysis
Building a Gene Co-Expression Network (WGCNA)  Group genes into clusters based on how their expression levels change together.  Find immune-related gene groups linked to TNBC progression. 

The largest modules detected included the turquoise (~812 genes), blue (~561 genes), and brown (~479 genes) modules, among others such as green, yellow, and red. Gene-module assignments were saved for downstream analyses. Preliminary enrichment analysis of the blue module suggested possible involvement in immune-related biological processes, including immune activation and cytokine signaling. These early findings highlight several modules of interest that may be linked to TNBC immune microenvironment dynamics.

Ongoing work includes deeper functional enrichment analysis to validate the immune relevance of specific modules, correlation with clinical traits such as immune infiltration scores, and survival outcome analysis. Protein-protein interaction networks and Kaplan-Meier survival models will further integrate WGCNA findings with clinical relevance to identify potential prognostic biomarkers in TNBC.
